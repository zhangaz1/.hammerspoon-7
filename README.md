# .hammerspoon

Personal [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) config.

## Features

- Completely modular and Spoon-based.
- Documented.
- Easy on system resources, even with all Spoons loaded. There're no redundant global objects, like application watchers. Plus, application specific objects like event taps and UI observers are stopped when the target app is deactivated.
